# CLI for McdJS

**English** | [简体中文](./README.md)

As we all know, *McdJS*, which has very strong compatibility, can not only run in local with Node.js, but also run in browser.

This package can provide a CLI for *McdJS* to use it more conveniently, just like other compliers.

However, *McdJS* is not a complier.
I'm just kidding.
