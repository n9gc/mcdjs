# McdJS

**English** | [简体中文](./README.md)

*McdJS*, whose full name is *JavaScript minecraft command generator with the idea of Minecraft Command Design*, is a generator of Minecraft command.

Commonly, you can use it by importing it in JS as a library.
However, the easier way to use is putting your code in '*.mcdjs' file, then you can think of this tool as a compiler which can turn your 'mcdjs' code to Minecraft command.
In this sense, it just like you are programming your command as if programming a JavaScript.
